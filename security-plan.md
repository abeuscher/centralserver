# Security Considerations - Multi-Client WordPress Environment

## Overview
Multi-client WordPress hosting requires layered security to protect against attacks that could affect multiple clients. Comments disabled and custom themes reduce attack surface significantly, but additional protections are essential.

## Host/Infrastructure Level

### Essential Tools
- **Fail2ban** - Automatic IP blocking for repeated failed logins, scanning attempts
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** - Basic port filtering (already implemented)
- **Automated security updates** - Container and OS level patching
- **Cloudflare** - CDN, WAF, bot protection, DDoS mitigation (highest ROI)

### Traefik Security Features
- **Rate limiting middleware** - Prevent resource exhaustion
- **IP whitelisting** - Restrict admin access by geography/IP ranges
- **Headers middleware** - Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

## WordPress/Application Level

### Critical Security Plugins
- **Wordfence Security** - Real-time threat detection, firewall, malware scanning
- **iThemes Security** - Alternative to Wordfence, comprehensive security suite
- **Limit Login Attempts Reloaded** - Brute force protection for login pages
- **WP Security Audit Log** - Activity monitoring and forensics

### Additional Hardening Plugins
- **WP Hardening** - Automated security hardening (file permissions, config)
- **Anti-Malware Security** - File integrity monitoring and cleanup
- **Disable XML-RPC** - Eliminates XML-RPC attack vector
- **WP Hide & Security Enhancer** - Obscures WordPress structure

## Database/Data Protection

### Backup and Recovery Tools
- **UpdraftPlus** - Automated WordPress backups with cloud storage
- **WP-CLI** - Command-line backup/restore operations
- **Percona XtraBackup** - Advanced MySQL point-in-time recovery

### Database Security
- **WP DB Manager** - Database optimization and cleanup
- **WP Security Scan** - Database vulnerability assessment

## Common Attack Vectors to Address

### Brute Force Attacks
- **Target**: `/wp-admin/`, `/wp-login.php`, xmlrpc.php
- **Mitigation**: Login limiting, Cloudflare, strong passwords, 2FA

### Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities
- **Target**: Outdated or vulnerable plugins
- **Mitigation**: Automated updates, security scanning, minimal plugin usage

### File Upload Attacks
- **Target**: Media uploads, theme/plugin uploads
- **Mitigation**: File type restrictions, upload directory permissions

### SQL Injection
- **Target**: Custom forms, search functions, plugin vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Input sanitization, WAF rules, prepared statements

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Target**: Contact forms, comments (disabled), user input fields
- **Mitigation**: Input validation, CSP headers, output encoding

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
1. **Cloudflare** setup for all client domains
2. **Fail2ban** configuration on server
3. **Wordfence** or **iThemes Security** on all WordPress installations
4. **Limit Login Attempts** plugin deployment

### Phase 2 (Development)
1. **Automated security updates** for containers
2. **Rate limiting** in Traefik configuration
3. **Security headers** middleware
4. **File integrity monitoring**

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
1. **Intrusion detection system (IDS)**
2. **Security audit logging** centralization
3. **Automated vulnerability scanning**
4. **Incident response procedures**

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Essential Monitoring
- **Failed login attempts** across all clients
- **File changes** in WordPress core/theme directories
- **Resource usage** spikes indicating attacks
- **SSL certificate** expiration alerts

### Log Analysis Tools
- **Logwatch** - Automated log analysis and reporting
- **GoAccess** - Real-time web log analyzer
- **Custom scripts** for multi-client log aggregation

## Notes
- **Container isolation** provides natural security boundaries between clients
- **Custom themes** significantly reduce attack surface vs. public themes
- **Disabled comments** eliminates major spam/injection vector
- **Regular security audits** and penetration testing recommended
- **Client education** about strong passwords and secure practices essential

## Emergency Response
- **Incident response plan** for compromised client sites
- **Client isolation procedures** to prevent lateral movement
- **Backup restoration** processes for rapid recovery
- **Communication protocols** for client notification during incidents
