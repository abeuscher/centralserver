# WordPress Containerized Client Management System

## System Overview

### Architecture Components

**Infrastructure Layer:**
- **Traefik Reverse Proxy**: Handles SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt), domain routing, and load balancing across all client containers
- **Docker Compose Orchestration**: Manages container lifecycle, networking, and volume mounting
- **DigitalOcean Droplets**: Scalable server infrastructure hosting multiple client environments

**Client Environment Structure:**
- **Production Containers**: Live client websites (client.domain.com)
- **Staging Containers**: Development and testing environments (staging.client.domain.com)  
- **Additional Environments**: Project-specific containers (branding.client.domain.com) for long-term development
- **Individual MySQL Containers**: Isolated databases per client for CiviCRM safety

**Development Workflow:**
- **Starter Repository**: Standardized foundation containing Node.js build system, Docker configuration, and WordPress setup
- **Client Repositories**: Forked from starter repo, containing client-specific themes, templates, and configurations
- **Build System**: Node.js process that converts Pug templates to PHP, compiles SCSS to CSS, and bundles JavaScript

**Content Management:**
- **WordPress XML Export/Import**: Safe content promotion system for posts, pages, and ACF data
- **File Synchronization**: rsync for uploads and media assets
- **ACF Pro Integration**: Field group export/import for custom content types

### Main Workflow

**Development Process:**
1. Developer works in local or staging environment
2. Node.js build system converts templates and assets
3. Git commits trigger deployment to staging containers
4. Client reviews changes in staging environment
5. Content and code promotion to production via XML export and git deployment

**Content Promotion:**
- Code changes: Git-based deployment
- Content changes: WordPress XML export/import + rsync for media
- CiviCRM changes: Maintenance window with direct production work

**Backup and Recovery:**
- Automated WordPress XML exports for content recovery
- Upload folder backups via rsync
- DigitalOcean snapshots for disaster recovery
- CiviCRM data preserved through database isolation

10. **File Synchronization**
    - rsync configuration for uploads folder
    - Media asset management between environments
    - Selective file promotion capabilities

11. **ACF Pro Integration**
    - Field group export/import automation
    - Custom content type promotion
    - Template and field synchronization

### Phase 5: Deployment and Promotion Workflows

12. **Git Integration**
    - Webhook configuration for automatic deployments
    - Branch-based environment management
    - Commit message triggers for promotion
    - Rollback capabilities

13. **CLI Management Tools**

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation

15. **Multi-Client Testing**
    - Deploy 2-3 test client environments
    - Verify isolation between clients
    - Test promotion and reset workflows

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Operational Boundaries

**Safe Operations (No Maintenance Window Required):**
- Theme template updates and styling changes
- New page templates and ACF field groups
- Content creation and editing
- Media uploads and management
- WordPress XML-based content promotion

**Maintenance Window Operations:**
- WordPress core updates
- Major plugin updates affecting database schema
- CiviCRM configuration changes
- Server scaling and infrastructure changes
- Database-level modifications

### Appendix B: CiviCRM Considerations

**Isolation Strategy:**
CiviCRM data remains isolated in production environments. No synchronization between staging and production for CiviCRM tables to prevent data corruption or loss.

**Update Procedures:**
CiviCRM updates require careful planning with full backups and testing procedures. Updates should be performed during scheduled maintenance windows with rollback plans.

**Data Integrity:**
WordPress XML export/import and file synchronization do not interfere with CiviCRM database tables, maintaining data integrity for contacts, donations, and other critical information.

### Appendix C: Security Considerations

**Container Isolation:**
Each client operates in isolated containers with separate databases and file systems, preventing cross-client data access or contamination.

**SSL Management:**
Automatic SSL certificate generation and renewal through Let's Encrypt integration with Traefik, ensuring secure connections for all client domains.

**Update Management:**
Centralized security monitoring required for WordPress core and plugin vulnerabilities. Consider implementing automated security scanning and alerting systems.

### Appendix D: Scaling Strategy

**Resource Management:**
Monitor server resources and client distribution. Plan for horizontal scaling across multiple DigitalOcean droplets as client base grows.

**Performance Optimization:**
Implement caching strategies (Redis, CDN) for high-traffic scenarios. Consider load testing procedures for clients expecting traffic spikes.

**Cost Management:**
Balance resource allocation between shared infrastructure savings and client isolation requirements. Monitor per-client resource usage for accurate pricing models.

### Appendix E: Future Enhancements

**Centralized Management:**
Consider developing a management container with WP-CLI capabilities for centralized WordPress and plugin updates across all client sites.

**Monitoring Dashboard:**
Implement comprehensive monitoring for all client environments with alerting for performance, security, and availability issues.

**Automated Client Onboarding:**
Develop automated scripts for complete client environment provisioning, from repository creation to container deployment.

**Advanced Backup Strategies:**
Implement more granular backup and restore capabilities, including point-in-time recovery and selective content restoration.
